## Model File Download

The trained DeBERTa weight file is not included in this repository because it is too large for GitHub.

Download `model.safetensors` from Google Drive:

```text
https://drive.google.com/file/d/19urlf53FooHujz5r6QyNGzT-g1ewBA7Z/view?usp=sharing
```

After downloading, place the file here:

```text
models/bert_model/model.safetensors
```

The final path must be:

```text
models/bert_model/model.safetensors
```

Without this file, the app will not be able to load the fine-tuned DeBERTa model.

---

## Run the App

From the project folder, run:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The app will open in your browser.

---

## Usage

1. Upload a CSV file containing customer reviews.
2. Select the column that contains the review text.
3. Choose the output format:
   - Add prediction columns to the original CSV
   - Export only the prediction results
4. Click **Analyze Sentiment**.
5. Review the sentiment distribution and confidence scores.
6. Download the results as a CSV file.

---

## Input CSV Format

Your CSV should contain at least one text column.

Example:

```csv
Review Text,Rating,Product
"Love this dress! Perfect fit.",5,Summer Dress
"Poor quality material.",2,Cotton Shirt
"It's okay, nothing special.",3,Jeans
```

---

## Output Format

The app adds the following columns:

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| `Predicted_Sentiment` | Predicted sentiment: negative, neutral, or positive |
| `Confidence (%)` | Model confidence score from 0 to 100 |

Example:

```csv
Review Text,Rating,Predicted_Sentiment,Confidence (%)
"Love this dress!",5,positive,96.8
"Poor quality.",2,negative,89.3
"It's okay.",3,neutral,78.5
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Model file not found

Make sure `model.safetensors` has been downloaded and placed in:

```text
models/bert_model/model.safetensors
```

### App does not start

Check that you are inside the project folder before running:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

You can confirm your current folder contains `app.py` by running:

```bash
ls
```
